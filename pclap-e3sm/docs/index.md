# Welcome to PCLAP docs

A place to put documentation for running code either produced or used by the PCLAP project.  For the time being, this repository is private, so it's also a fine place to keep notes and drafts; just the usual cautions about nothing ECI or PPI since the git history will record everything.

## Repositories

All of these documentation files refer to the PCLAP forks that exist in the [PCLAP github space](https://github.com/PCLAeroParams).  It's not guaranteed that changes made by PCLAP will be pushed upstream to the main repositories.
